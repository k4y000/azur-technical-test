## Installation

To get started, you need to clone this repository and install the dependencies.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Install dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install both the production dependencies (e.g., `express`) and the development dependencies (e.g., `nodemon`).

## Usage

To start the development server with `nodemon`, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server whenever code changes are made.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the server with `nodemon`.
- `npm test`: This command currently does nothing but outputs an error message. You can configure it to run your tests later.

## Dependencies

- `express`: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `nodemon`: A utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the server.
